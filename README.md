## It doesn't seem lightweight

That's true. The environment is relatively heavy.

LightAntiCheat has been an idea I got while participating in the ShadowAntiCheat rewrite. We have been talking about threads and outsourcing calculations. LAC was born.

## Why should you use LAC?

Honestly, at the current point in time, there is no reason to even give it a try.
Later into development, it will feature preventions for most public cheats, as well as few false-positives.
